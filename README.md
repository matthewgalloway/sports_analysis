## Research Questions

Statistical analysis of sports data to understand important variables for match predictions has been a study of the machine learning literature in the last 10 years[1], [2]. Predominantly focused on well established sports, more niche sports like mixed martial arts (MMA) have been largely ignored [3]. MMA presents an interesting problem, as a fighters skill set appears to be an important predictor of the winner of a fight (28 current champions are wrestlers, whilst 6 are kickboxers). All martial arts specialise in one method of winning either knockouts (from standing position) or submissions (from ground position). As both are permitted in MMA, a successful fighter must amalgamate two or more traditional martial arts categories to be successful. As there is currently no accurate way to describe a fighters style or understanding of the success of a style the first research question is: 

1: Can infight statistics and a fighters physical attributes be used to define styles and what is the difference in win rate of each style? 

Additionally if styles are considered important predictors for a fight, differences between the attributes used to define styles are likely to provide important information 
in to what makes a fighter successful, prompting the second research question: 

2. What are the important physical attribute and skill differences between fighters when predicting the outcome of a fight?
